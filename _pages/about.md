Hi! I am **Prabhav Singh**, an undergraduate student at [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University](http://www.nsut.ac.in/). I am pursuing my B.E. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. However, my interests lie in the filed of Computer Science - A departure from my original major. Most of my formal and informal training is in the field of Supervised ML and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am experienced in **multimodal learning and multimodal learning representations in language and speech processing**.

I am currently working as Undergraduate Research Assistant at NSIT under [Prof. KPS Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) and [Prof. Vineet Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/drvineetkumar27/). I also recently interning as a Research Scientist (NLP) at [D.Kraft Learning](https://dkraftlearning.com/) under [Prof. Debarka Sengupta](https://www.debarka.com/team/debarka).



My Research Interests
------
I leverage machine learning algorithms to improve human-computer interaction. More precisely, my research is aimed at improving the state of language processing to improve communication between human's and computers. I am also interested in the a **multimodal aspect of HCI** and thus some of my work is also aimed at combining NLP with other modalities - most frequently speech.

My other research interests include:
1. Multimodal techniques for fake news detection along with event discrimination. I am working on systems that can effectively detect fake news using not just text, but other modalities of inputs as well (Images, Videos, GIFs).
2. Automatic Question Answering Systems & Conversational AIs.
3. Unsupervised approaches to text summarization.
4. The applications of AI to medicine and healthcare. I have experience working with EEG processing as well as 2D and 3D MRI segmentation and anamoly detection. My previous work also includes leveraging NLP on open source data to analyze trends in healthcare - specifically COVID-19 related scenarios.

You can read more about what I am doing now in the Current Research Section.
I am still a beginner in the world of research and I am hoping to expand my knowledge in these areas by pursuing my master's in 2022.
