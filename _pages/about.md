Hi! I am **Prabhav Singh**, an undergraduate student at [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University](http://www.nsut.ac.in/). I am pursuing my B.E. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. However, my interests lie in the filed of Computer Science - A departure from my original major. Most of my formal and informal training is in the field of Supervised ML and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am experienced in the **applications of these technologies to language and speech processing**.

I am currently working as Undergraduate Research Assistant at NSIT under [Prof. KPS Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) and [Prof. Vineet Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/drvineetkumar27/). I am also interning as a Research Scientist (NLP) at [D.Kraft Learning](https://dkraftlearning.com/) under [Prof. Debarka Sengupta](https://www.debarka.com/team/debarka).



My Research Interests
------
I leverage machine learning algorithms to improve human-computer interaction. More precisely, my research is aimed at improving the state of language processing to improve communication between human's and computers. I am also interested in the a **multimodal aspect of HCI** and thus some of my work is also aimed at combining NLP with other modalities - most frequently speech.

I have also tinkered in the applications of AI to medicine and healthcare. I have experience working with EEG processing as well as 2D and 3D MRI segmentation and anamoly detection. My previous work also includes leveraging NLP on open source data to analyze trends in healthcare - specifically COVID-19 related scenarios.

I am still a beginner in the world of research and I am hoping to expand my knowledge in these areas by pursuing my master's in 2022.
