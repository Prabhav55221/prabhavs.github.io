Hi! I am Prabhav Singh, an undergraduate student at [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University](http://www.nsut.ac.in/). I am pursuing my B.E. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. However, my interests lie in the filed of Computer Science - A departure from my original major. Most of my formal and informal training is in the field of Supervised ML and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am experienced in the applications of these technologies to language and speech processing.

I am currently working as Undergraduate Research Assistant at NSIT under [Prof. KPS Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) and [Prof. Vineet Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/drvineetkumar27/). I am also interning as a Research Scientist (NLP) at [D.Kraft Learning](https://dkraftlearning.com/) under [Prof. Debarka Sengupta](https://www.debarka.com/team/debarka).


My Interests
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

My Research
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
